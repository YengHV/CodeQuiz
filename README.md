For this assignment, we were suppose to create a quiz using javascript. 
This assignment contains index.html, script.js, style.css, and a psuedo code.
I created a html file and use javascript to create a short quiz. 
When opened, the web will have a button to start the quiz.
A small list of questions will pop out and the user will chose an option containing the right answers.
there are buttons to select the answers and a small promte will notify if the writer chose the correct answers or not.
I have included a timer, but was not able to figure out to start it when the user press the start button. 
I was not able to get a score board for the end of the quiz.
This assignment to me was harder and I had anticipated.
